              that can be used to support the quality evaluation of SPL feature
              models. The S.P.L.O.T. repository has over six hundred (600)
              models entered by the SPL community to download. The MAcchiATO is
              composed of two parts: (i) a set of 218 feature models fetched
              from S.P.L.O.T repository; and (ii) a compiled spreadsheet
              containing the values of 32 quality measures, which composes the
              COfFEE, for each one of 218 features models. MAcchiATO can be used
              to explored many data analysis techniques for different purposes.

              (mEasures dataSet for dsPl featuRE mOdel) is a dataset built to
              support quality evaluation of DSPL feature models. The ESPREssO
              dataset consists of: (i) a set of 30 DSPL feature models from the
              literature; and (ii) a compiled spreadsheet containing the values
              of 13 quality measures for each of the 30 selected models. The 13
              measures that make up the dataset and the 4 specific ones for
              DSPL. The 9 SPL-related measures cover 5 sub-characteristics of
              maintainability, but specifically: Analybility (NLeaf), Cognitive
              Complexity (CogC), Flexibility (FoC), Structural Complexity (DT,
              NF, RDen) and Variability (RoV, NVC, NO). The 4 specific measures
              for DSPL are: Context Features (CF), Constraint Context Features
              (CFC), Context Activated Features (AFCA), and Context Disabled
              Features (DFCA).
